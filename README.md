            <p>
            I'm LJ Connolly, a PhD student in Texts and Technology at the University of Central Florida. With a BA in Writing from the University of Tampa and a MA in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies from the University of South Florida, I am interested in studying how critical data studies intersect with feminist and queer theory. More specifically, I am passionate about uncovering how systems like educational platforms and public health visualizations shape our collective understanding of social realities.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            I am a writer, editor, and researcher with a passion for exploring digital rhetoric, critical data studies, and inclusive design. My work bridges academic research and creative practice: I examine issues of gender, technology, and culture, develop instructional resources that center equity in Kâ€“12 and adult education, and cultivate community projects that spark dialogue through art and narrative. Whether I'm editing technical documents or crafting research articles, I'm driven by the belief that writing and design can both challenge systems and foster community connection.
